Monitor EDID & metadata database.
Intended to gather information around home/consumer displays, with a special
interest on overscan behaviour.

Useful for analysis, such as:
	What EDID versions are most common?
	How widespread is GTF support?
	How widespread is CVT support?
	How many TVs have reasonable overscan behaviour for input from a PC?


EDID FILENAME FORMAT

The EDID filename should be based around the vendor and model number
visible on the product or product materials. Try to keep it short and
technical, for example the Sony Bravia TV123 would just be "Sony-TV123".

You then end it with an extension according to the connection to the TV
from which you obtained the EDID. Options are: HDMI, VGA, DVI
