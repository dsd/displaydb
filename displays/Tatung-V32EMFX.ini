vendor=Tatung
model=V32EMFX
notes=TV found in Howard Plaza Hotel, Taipei. No visible model name, and TV is bolted to wall, can't read the labels behind, so I'm going with the model name in the EDID.

type=TV
technology=LCD
overscan=Yes
overscan_configurable=Yes
overscan_notes=Configuration under Menu -> Picture -> Aspect Ratio. "Medium" means underscan. Default seems to be "Full" (overscan), but I can't verify with a factory reset because that menu item is password protected.
